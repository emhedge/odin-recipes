        <h2><i>Decadently delicious, a perfect balance of sweetness for a health-conscious eater</i></h2>

            Somedays, I swear could sit and eat cookies until I make myself sick. Thankfully, 
            my partner is an absolute savant in the kitchen, and she blends a passion and 
            skill for baking that ensures our sweets arsenal is always fully stocked, 
            regardless of my late-night munchies.

            One of my favorites, the double chocolate goji berry cookies, is a great option 
            for these days. They're lower in sugar, packed full of goji berries for antioxidant goodness, and to top it off, they're vegan (if that's your thing).

            If I talk about this any longer, I may have to walk away from the keyboard and 
            make some myself. 
            <!-- This recipe should make about # cookies -->

            <p>
                <i>*First, preheat over to 170 degrees celsius</i>
            </p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    First, beat up 2 kinds of sugar and cold coconut oil (or soft butter) 
                    with a hand mixer until it’s a bit fluffy. Then add flax eggs and 
                    beat up until they’re combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next, sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and baking soda. 
                    Add the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, along with the chopped 
                    chocolate and drained goji berries. Use a spatula to mix it up until 
                    it’s well combined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    After everything is mixed well, shape each piece of cookie dough 
                    into a 120g ball before slightly pressing the dough before baking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake at 170 degree celsius for 16 min or until cooked through.
                </li>
            </ol>
