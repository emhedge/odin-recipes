            Somedays, I swear could sit and eat cookies until I make myself sick. Thankfully, 
            my partner is an absolute savant in the kitchen, and she blends a passion and 
            skill for baking that ensures our sweets arsenal is always fully stocked, 
            regardless of my late-night munchies.

            One of my favorites, the double chocolate goji berry cookies, is a great option 
            for these days. They're lower in sugar, packed full of goji berries for antioxidant goodness, and to top it off, they're vegan (if that's your thing).

            If I talk about this any longer, I may have to walk away from the keyboard and 
            make some myself. 
            <!-- This recipe should make about # cookies -->
