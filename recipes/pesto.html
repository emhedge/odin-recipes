            Considering pesto is known for being high in fat, perhaps 'lean' isn't 
            the best descriptor for this dish. But, hey, we've learned that most of the 
            original research into fat and its impact on our health was <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20071648" target="_blank" 
            rel="noopener noreferrer">inaccurate</a>, and in fact good fats, like olive oil, can be part of a <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/the-truth-about-fats-bad-and-good" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthful diet.</a>

            <i>Have I bored you to sleep yet?</i> Fear not, I'll move on to the crux of this recipe: the rich, garlicy blend 
            of fresh basil and crunchy walnut. My partner knows I like bold, big flavors, and this dish delivers on that front.
            Paired with a nice bread, pita, cracker, or even a tortilla, this dish shines and is sure to make you go "mmm" -- you know,
            the yummy kind of moan.

            Despite containing no dairy products, this pesto recipe packs the full pesto punch
            you expect, and it's surprisingly simple to put together.
