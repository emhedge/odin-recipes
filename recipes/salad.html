            <p>
                I'll be honest with you: potato salad was never my thing. Despite growing up in the grey area 
                between the midwest and the south that is southern Missouri, I could never really wrap my head
                around the appeal of it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Years later and halfway around the world, my partner introduced me to this delicious purple medley,
                 and I was baffled by how delicious I found it. The beets bring a deeper and richer flavor to the dish
                  and, along with the vegan mayo, avoid the overtly <em>creamy</em> vibes of the traditional dish.

                Served cold, this dish is a great complement to a hearty, warm entree, or it can be packed along with 
                other light dishes for a picnic.
